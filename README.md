This is an early experimental version of the new Undiscovered Worlds, with globes!
The original (and more fully functional) version, with flat maps, can be found at Undiscovered_Worlds_Classic.


The version here will create spherical planets in a variety of styles. You can move around them, change the texture colours and shader effects, and get information about particular points.
There is not yet any eqiuvalent to regional maps, so the level of detail is relatively low.
It is not possible to save/load worlds or to create custom worlds.

This project requires the rlImGui library to function: https://github.com/raylib-extras/rlImGui

**Known issues (causes all unknown!):**

The same seed does not always produce the same planet.

Occasionally, the program crashes at an early stage of planet generation.

The location of the highlight marker on the planet's surface is not always accurate.
